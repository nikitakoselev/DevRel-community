# Connecting Supply Chain Security Projects to the Community – Exploring OpenSSF’s DevRel Mission
​
[Securing Open Source Software Community Day - April 15, 2024](https://sched.co/1aNLY)
​
## Abstract
​
Under the hood of most software is a complex system of tooling, processes, and, ultimately, humans. Ensuring the system's integrity and hardening our software supply chain requires careful configuration at countless steps along the pipeline. Similarly, community efforts to develop standards, tools, and education also require contributions from a diverse group of technologists and communicators to keep projects, conversations, and outreach moving forward. The new OpenSSF DevRel community was formed to advance the mission of the OpenSSF by evangelizing its projects. This panel of DevRel Community volunteers will share the many ways we leverage our varied experiences to fill the critical gap between code and communication. We will further outline the many values of non-code contributions in organizations like the OpenSSF and share tips for getting involved.
